<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">My history with this game goes back 10 years ago. I hate the OG game. I hate the Special Edition. And in comparison, I love DMC3 and DMC5. The reason for that is because of the following points I’ll explain.</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">N&amp;D (short for Nero &amp; Dante) are heavily weak compared to the enemy roster.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Dante is especially nerfed from his DMC3 counterpart.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">Weapon cycling is not suited for an action game and especially a character like Dante, and is implemented very badly in DMC4.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Yamato is NOT DARK SLAYER moves!</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="11">The Style Switching is OVERRATED, and I have proved it with my Steam Controller Configuration.</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">Before we begin, we must speak about the enemies of DMC.</p>
<h1 class="code-line" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="15"><a id="Enemies_in_DMC4_Compared_to_3__5_13"></a>Enemies in DMC4 Compared to 3 &amp; 5</h1>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="21">Enemies in DMC4 are more aggressive and have a smaller JC box compared to 3&amp;5.<br>
With all that said, this should not be counted as a con but as a pro.<br>
Tougher enemies are way more satisfying to defeat and style on them compared to dummy enemies that don’t do anything.<br>
And you know what? It’s ok to have a small JC box (although, why do I have to buy this nuanced ability?) As long as the game provides the player with enough [b]conventional[/b] tools to defeat its enemies, I am A-OK.<br>
So after playing this game for so long, my only conclusion to this game’s characters’ moveset is…</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start="22" data-line-end="24"><a id="ND_are_Heavily_Weak__So_Lets_Start_with_Nero_22"></a>N&amp;D are Heavily Weak - So Let’s Start with Nero</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">Nero’s moveset is more or less OK, but it ain’t satisfying nor does it mesh together when playing against certain enemies.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28"><a id="His_Moveset_Only_Lets_You_to_Move_Forward_27"></a>His Moveset Only Lets You to Move Forward</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30">Nero’s moveset overall is centered around one direction - forward. This makes Nero a flawed character against the following enemies:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="31" data-line-end="32">Enemies with plants force Nero to play outside of the “Fun zone” of DMC (i.e., combos, air combos, etc.).</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="34">Bosses with AOE attacks.</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="35">If Nero wants to bail out of combat, he must literally walk backwards or do a reverse Calibur glitch. The latter of which is not an actual mechanic.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start="36" data-line-end="37"><a id="All_Basic_Attacks_With_No_Exceed_Are_Annoyingly_Slow_36"></a>All Basic Attacks (With No Exceed) Are Annoyingly Slow</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="38" data-line-end="49">Am I the only one who noticed Nero is using the Red Queen as a surfboard to whack his enemies in the 1st cutscene?<br>
A move you can never do in gameplay.<br>
Why am I mentioning this? Well, it’s because I have a theory that the Exceed ability was a quick, cheap gimmick Capcom threw in when rushing to deliver this game.<br>
And because of that, Nero has become one of the most tiresome characters to play with.<br>
Trying to exceed with Red Queen 24/7 is NOT FUN - PERIOD.<br>
There are zero reasons for a player to not exceed.<br>
Nero’s “default” moves are clumsy, slow, and inefficient for combat.<br>
You want to get to moves fast and strong, not slow and weak.<br>
“Duh, noob, GG, just exceed consistently” - I do, A-Hole, but the gimmick does not make Red Queen more complex to use.<br>
It just makes it tiresome to press the button over and over and over again.<br>
If Red Queen would allow you to ride the sword (JUST LIKE IN THE 1st CUTSCENE):</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="50" data-line-end="51">Nero would have been more mobile and allow players to move in many directions.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="51" data-line-end="53">Allow Nero’s default combos to be fast and balanced.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start="53" data-line-end="54"><a id="Initial_Controller_Setup_Is_Not_Good_for_Nero_53"></a>Initial Controller Setup Is Not Good for Nero</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="57">You can call this a nitpick or not valid because you can change the button mapping.<br>
However, this should not be glossed over since it perfectly captures just how unbaked this game is. You have 2 button moves that can be held.</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="58" data-line-end="59">You have to grab &amp; hold the enemy as a meat shield.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="59" data-line-end="61">Charge shot.</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="61" data-line-end="65">However, Capcom thought that it would be better to map them to the face buttons instead of the triggers.<br>
But the BS exceed button? Oh yeah, let’s map it to the trigger.<br>
Great job, Capcom, you just made Nero arbitrarily harder to play.<br>
And this default button map is also present in DMC5, BTW.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start="66" data-line-end="67"><a id="Overall_66"></a>Overall</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="68" data-line-end="70">Nero is an imperfect character that is at least compatible with most enemies in 4.<br>
And as a result, he’s not a fun character to play with.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start="71" data-line-end="73"><a id="Dante_and_DMC4Hook_71"></a>Dante and DMC4Hook</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="74" data-line-end="76">In an unmodded D MC4, Dante is one of the most stiff, clunky, and underpowered characters to play with.<br>
Comparing Dante from 3 to 4:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="77" data-line-end="78">In 3, Dante could dash 3 times in regular form, in 4 only once unless you DT.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="78" data-line-end="79">In 3, most enemies can be juggled with E&amp;I in regular form, in 4 some enemies can only be juggled with E&amp;I in DT Form.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="79" data-line-end="80">Gun Stinger has massive recovery frames in 4.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="80" data-line-end="82">JC combo potential is significantly smaller than in 3.</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="82" data-line-end="85">The logical reason for these kinds of changes is because Dante is now able to wield all weapons and styles at once.<br>
However, Capcom went WAY TOO FAR WITH THESE NERFS.<br>
Let’s break them down now and bring their fixes done by DMC4Hook mod (and my Steam Config Mod, *Ahem*).</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start="86" data-line-end="87"><a id="Weapon_Cycling_86"></a>Weapon Cycling</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="88" data-line-end="96">Weapon cycling is okay when a character does not have to rely on switching constantly.<br>
However, DMC4 incentivizes weapon switching in a lot of cases for both stylish and efficient play.<br>
BUT… for some odd reasons… Capcom thought it would be “fair” to put a time limit between each time you switch any weapon.<br>
This makes it much harder to cycle to the desired weapon for split-second decision making.<br>
This bullsh*t time limit, which prevents you from switching weapons fast, can be turned off using the DMC4Hook mod.<br>
And thanks to this mod, I was finally able to make a stable Steam Ctrl Config.<br>
This allows me to tap 1 button for any Devil Arm I desired, making weapon switching much more enjoyable.<br>
This also includes Yamato, the so-called “Dark Slayer” Style. Let’s speak about his so-called style.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start="97" data-line-end="98"><a id="Yamato_is_NOT_DARK_SLAYER_Moves_97"></a>Yamato is NOT DARK SLAYER Moves!</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="99" data-line-end="108">There’s really nothing to explain here, Dark Slayer should not have been Yamato moves slapped into Dante’s style system.<br>
The “style” allows you to use Dante’s 4th Devil Arm… so why is it not in the weapon cycle?<br>
Is it because it contains barely any moves from Vergil’s DMC3 moves? Because, the last time I checked, Vergil’s Dark Slayer moves are just advanced teleporting moves.<br>
So why the f*ck make it a style and not a weapon, CAPCOM?! WHAT-WERE-YOU-THINKING!!!<br>
Oh well, all I can say is, after modding the controller via Steam, it feels so good to switch to Yamato like a weapon.<br>
Like, I can actually string some cool moves against all enemies with Yamato.<br>
And this wouldn’t have been possible if DMC4Hook didn’t toggle off another bullsh*t time limit for style switching.<br>
Yup, Capcom really wanted to make people hate this game.<br>
Speaking of which, it’s time to address this glorified feature called style switching.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start="109" data-line-end="110"><a id="The_Style_Switching_is_OVERRATED_and_I_Have_Proved_It_with_My_Steam_Controller_Configuration_Before_and_Now_109"></a>The Style Switching is OVERRATED, and I Have Proved It with My Steam Controller Configuration Before and Now</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="111" data-line-end="112">Let’s go over the “styles”:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="113" data-line-end="114">Trickster allows you to dodge and cover a lot of ground fast.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="114" data-line-end="115">Royal Guard allows you to block and counter.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="115" data-line-end="116">Sword Master adds extra random moves to your Devil Arms.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="116" data-line-end="118">Gunslinger adds extra random moves to your long-range weapons.</li>
</ol>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="118" data-line-end="124">If style switching would change Dante’s regular moves to be suited to the styles’ nature, I wouldn’t complain about this. But style switching is a fancy way to make players press more buttons to execute dodge and block.<br>
It doesn’t change the way players play with Dante, just look at how most veterans play with Dante.<br>
They don’t play defensively with Royal Guard nor do they play the long-range game with Gunslinger.<br>
They always go for air combos.<br>
So again, other than making me press more buttons to pull a certain move, how does it come into play? There isn’t.<br>
Capcom just added this because they had more RAM in PS3 to cram more moves into Dante in DMC4.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="125" data-line-end="129">See, the thing is, DMC3 had this idea for players to stick with a certain style to make play in a certain way.<br>
This was to make the gameplay feel different each time you load a different style.<br>
Moreover, since the styles could be leveled up by playing with them, it incentivized players to focus on mastering each style.<br>
In DMC4, however, Dante is just thrown in there with all styles.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="130" data-line-end="135">A lot of veterans like to say, “well, Capcom made Dante a learning curve to play with” - to which I say, stop deluding yourself.<br>
Capcom rushed to deliver this game.<br>
Do you honestly think they would ship Dante’s moveset like this (with the style switching) if they had enough time to work on him?<br>
NO, they wouldn’t, they would have made Dante’s moveset stay the same at its core (i.e. R1 to lock, 🔼 to slash &amp; ⏹ to shoot) But re-made his moveset to accommodate the enemies in this game.<br>
“Duuhh, you’re a lost 'cause. DMC5 has style switching &amp; weapon cyclying as well”. Welp, my naive dumb reader, this can all be blamed on the same community that made this game an infested combo fest.</p>
<h2 class="code-line" data-line-start="136" data-line-end="138"><a id="Why_a_communitys_opinion_matter_136"></a>Why a community’s opinion matter</h2>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="139" data-line-end="147">Unless you’re living under a rock, you must know by now that alot of DMC players practice Dante to get those sweet 30 seconds combo clips in training mode.<br>
This is all because certain players like Donguri showcase just how awesome Dante if you manage to somehow master Dantes controls.<br>
Some players even showcase their “journey” into mastering Dante.<br>
While I don’t hate this players at all, I do have to state the following fact.<br>
If the DMC community didn’t endorse these sh*tty controls, we would have never got these same type of controls in DMC5.<br>
But for some reason, Some members of the community are a literal DMC4 fanatics that would condescend any player that would dare critic this half baked game.<br>
Sure, they would agree that Dante doesn’t have his own levels, but as for gameplay - NOPE, IT’S PERFECT; GET GOOD BRO.<br>
This f*cking toxic mentally is what let’s companies like Capcom keep getting away with half baked games and repeating mistakes.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="148" data-line-end="152">It’s the reason why Nero’s default button map is the same as 4, and it’s the reason why Capcom didn’t bother to fix DMC4 with the SE. It’s kinda similiar with Assassins’ Creed.<br>
The 1st was a stealth game, the others, were a boring open world game (that includes 2).<br>
Fans gobbled the 2nd game without realizing it threw away the stealth aspect.<br>
In DMC’s case (from DMC5 and DMC3 N-Switch Edition), fans turned this game from a simple yet challenging action game, into a combo fest with bloated movesets.</p>
<h1 class="code-line" data-line-start="153" data-line-end="155"><a id="Conclusion_153"></a>Conclusion</h1>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="156" data-line-end="159">With the evidance I presented thus far, we can safely conclude that DMC4 is NOT A FUN GAME FOR THE AVERAGE gamer.<br>
The aggresive nature of the enemies + the weak moveset N&amp;D get makes the gameplay 1000% frustrating.<br>
Download DMC4Hook if you want to fix this game. As for me, I think I’m gonna take a break from playing sh*tty games for a while.</p>
